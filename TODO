Write tests that check the implementation of asynchronous operation for a listening socket and several connected sockets. <- out of date

Write tests to fire up two daemons, let each create a node and let those nodes connect with a pre shared secret over a secure tcp connection.

Beforehand write a test for the not implemeted control connection protocol and its behaviour. This is needed to control the daemons at all.
This involves to test the command line ncot client which establishes such a connection.

Or we could write a testsuite where we call the libncot routines by hand, mimicking a client and two daemons and do the connections by hand.

Maybe first work on proper libncot function names to get a clean interface. schema is:

ncot_<library_part>_function_name where library_part is something like circle, node, controlpacket, request and such.

Get this stuff running !!
