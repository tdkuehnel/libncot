Network of Trust

A network of trust in the meaning of this document refers to the loosely connected rings of trust it consists of.

A ring of trust is a decentralized structure. A ring of trust consists of at least 3 nodes connected in a circular fashion. The maximum number of nodes in a ring of trust is not defined. By the circular design of the structure the integrity of the ring can be checked by transferring a cryptographically signed token around the ring in either direction, similar to the token ring physical network topology. When the ring is intact, the message will arrive from the other side where the originator can make sure its the original token by checking the validity of the cryptographic signature of the token.

The checked integrity of the ring makes sure that a: every node is what it claims to be, and b: every node is reachable.

The creation of a ring of trust occurs inherently when more than two nodes decide to share the same common security token, in particular a private key. That means, every node in the circular designed network is able to sign and encrypt messages as it is able to proof signature and decrypt. The term "ring" refers to the circular design of the connected nodes, while the term "trust" refers to the confidence the nodes have to each other. (This may not be true. With DH cryptography a node can encrypt a single message with the public keys of every node he thinks is in the circle so that the integrity of the ring can be used this way. No "shared secret" necessary.)

In the commonly and widespread use of cryptographic procedures the isolation of every node is significant, i.e. the private secrets are kept private, no one else should have access to it. When the exposure of such a private token against all precautions occurs, the security system based on it usually simpyl breaks and the node is compromised. Often without the knowledge of the node itself, until real damage happens by exploiting the security whole opened by the exposure of the private security token. Then, new security tokens have to be generated, issued certificates based on it renewed, the invalid ones have to be revocated and so on. This process often has to be done at least partly manually. (This may no longer be correct either)

In a circle of trust, the participating nodes are in a steadily connected and trusted state, that means, when a security problem arises, the remaining nodes can take immediate actions to reestablish the integrity of the ring. (This should be true nevertheless)

For describing all the benefits a ringlike security topology brings, we take the state of an established ring consisting of 5 nodes as an example. How a ring like this can be established is described later in this document.

A connection between two participating nodes is allways cryptographically secured by the use of common cryptographic protocol patterns. Every node can be in on of three connection related states: a) not connected at all b) connected to one other node which means the node is the end node of a ring in a broken state and when only one other node exists at the connected side a ringlike structure is no longer existant and the ring decomposes or c) connected to two other nodes which means it is a node in a valid or broken ring. Every node can at any time determine the validity status of the ring it is part of by issuing a security token in either direction of its neighboring nodes. When the token arrives in a predefined amount of time from the other side, the ring is considered intact. The round send security token can carry information from the participating nodes to get information of current ring parameters like number of nodes, how long each node participates, each nodes network address for direct communication with a node in the ring and so on.

A network of trust consists of at least 3 nodes, each trusting the other both. When one node loses confidence in one of the other two, onl two trusting nodes remain which could no more be described as a network but rather a pair of trust.
